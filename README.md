# Thesis Project – Metaheuristic Optimization and Neural Networks

This repository contains the source code, experiments, and documentation developed for my thesis project. The work focuses on the implementation and evaluation of population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms and their application to optimization problems and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs.

Overview

The project provides Python implementations of several widely used metaheuristic optimization techniques, alongside experimental scripts used to study neural network fundamentals and validate optimization performance.

The repository is intended to serve both as:

A research artifact supporting the results presented in the thesis

A learning resource for students and practitioners interested in optimization algorithms and basic neural network concepts

Implemented Algorithms

The following optimization algorithms are implemented from scratch in Python:

Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Evolutionary optimization method inspired by natural selection, using operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Swarm-based optimization algorithm inspired by social behavior in nature, where particles collaboratively search the solution space.

Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)
Bio-inspired optimization algorithm based on the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales.

Artificial Neural Networks

In addition to the optimization algorithms, the repository includes:

Example scripts and work files used to learn and test the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks

Experimental code to analyze network behavior and optimization performance

Supporting material used during the development and validation phases of the thesis

These files are primarily educational and exploratory in nature.

Thesis Document

A viewable version of the thesis manuscript is included in the repository. It provides:

Theoretical background on the implemented algorithms

Description of the experimental setup

Discussion of results and conclusions

(Folder names may vary slightly depending on the repository version.)

Requirements

Python 3.x

Standard scientific Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib)

Additional dependencies, if any, are documented within the individual scripts.

Usage

Each algorithm and experiment can be run independently. Refer to the corresponding folders and scripts for usage details and configuration parameters.

This repository is primarily intended for academic and educational purposes rather than as a production-ready optimization library.
