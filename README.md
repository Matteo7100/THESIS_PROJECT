# Thesis Project – Toward AI-assisted discoveries in science

This repository contains the source code, experiments, and documentation developed for my thesis project. The work focuses on the implementation and evaluation of population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms and the application of artificial neural networks in the context of scientific research, specifically for the investigation and discovery of algebraic properties characterizing algebraic structures of high complexity. In particular, the first phase of the work focuses on the design and development of a generative adversarial neural network (GAN) aimed at generating such algebraic equations.

## Overview

The project provides Python implementations of several widely used metaheuristic optimization techniques, alongside experimental scripts used to study neural network fundamentals and validate optimization performance with different parameters configurations.

The repository is intended to serve both as:
* **A research artifact** supporting the results presented in the thesis.
* **A learning resource** for students and practitioners interested in optimization algorithms and basic neural network concepts.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following optimization algorithms are implemented from scratch in Python:

* **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
    An evolutionary optimization method inspired by natural selection, using operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

* **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
    A swarm-based optimization algorithm inspired by social behavior in nature, where particles collaboratively search the solution space.

* **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)**
    A bio-inspired optimization algorithm based on the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales.

## Artificial Neural Networks

In addition to the optimization algorithms, the repository includes:

* **Example scripts and work files** used to learn and test the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks.
* **Experimental code** to analyze network behavior and optimization performance.
* **Supporting material** used during the development and validation phases of the thesis.

> **Note:** These files are primarily educational and exploratory in nature.
